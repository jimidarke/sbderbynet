## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority (Stability)**
   - HLS Feed TS file cleanup
   - Network stability for timers
   - Unified logging implementation

2. **Medium Priority (Features)**
   - Kiosk status display
   - Testing framework basics
   - Documentation updates

3. **Lower Priority (Enhancements)**
   - Service discovery
   - Advanced testing
   - Admin dashboards

## Next Steps

The implementation will begin with the highest priority items focused on stability and reliability, followed by feature enhancements and finally architectural improvements for long-term maintenance.
