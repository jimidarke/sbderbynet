A custom PCB board was developed that plugs into a Raspberry Pi Zero W and acts as an interface for the Derby Net system, mainly for recording when individual cars cross the finish line. 

All boards will have a serial ID starting with DT_54siv_#### where #### is a sequential number between 0 and 9 (first batch only. Other batches will have a different starting value and restarted sequences)

The device has the following features:
- 18650 Battery Management for charging and discharging and works for about 5-6 hours.
- Can measure battery capacity through an ADC (voltage sensor)
- 4 pin DIP switch allows for user-programmable settings such as lane selector or special cases
- header for a RGB LED for status indication 
- header for a 4-digit 7-segment display (for pinny number, etc.)
- header for a toggle (on/off) to capture finish timing
- onboard led battery soc indicators (green/yellow/red)

setup.sh contains 
- installs the python files as a system service
- installs the dependencies and libraries 
- checks if the hostname matches the boot/derbyid.txt file, if not set the hostname and restart 

finishtimer.py is run as a service
